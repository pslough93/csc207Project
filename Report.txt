Stage 3 Report

- Features:
  -Our algorithm is very fast, and provides a schedule that should work every time with minimal travel violations.
  -We have an easy to use JavaSwing GUI (found in program.jar) that lets people easily input files and such.
  -Our schedule is saved in a text file for easy printing.
  
- We chose our license because we decided that our program is good, but not groundbreaking and people should be 
  free to use our software with citation. If this was a significantly more advanced piece of software, it would
  require a commercial license, but for now, the MIT license because it is the most free to the user. 
  
- We use randomness somewhat cleverly, as we randomize the initial configuration of the teams to have the byes work
  out as well, and we additionally swap "rows" of the schedule randomly and find a somewhat optimal schedule.

- To extend this next semester we would first work out how to implement the back to back weekends, then we might 
  abstract the program to work with different types of schedules and sports. We might also try to get rid of some
  of the randomness by making the random swapping more evaluatative of whether or not a row swap is good or bad.
